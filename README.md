git-novice
==========

An introduction to version control for single users using git. This lesson
doesn't cover collaborative git, but does introduce users to pushing to remote
repositories for personal use. 
Please see <https://illinois-cse.github.io/git-local-fa18/> for a rendered version of this material.

This lesson is an abridged version of and 
heavily influenced by the carpentries' lesson `git-novice`. Please refer to
that material for additional information on git. 

If you're interested in a good example of a paper with scripts to reproduce the
data and how data is managed in a research repository, Nelle Varoquaux has a
very good example here: https://github.com/NelleV/takefive

For an example of a more complex document, like a dissertation, you can look at
Kelly Rowland's example repository here:
https://github.com/kellyrowland/dissertation-demo . This divides up the thesis
into separate chapters, so your .tex documents won't get incredibly long and
unmanageable. 

If you aren't sure about writing a paper this way and you'd like something
rendered more frequently, you
can instead use Overleaf, which renders the paper for you alongside the raw tex
files. Overleaf
offers github integration. You can read about that here:
