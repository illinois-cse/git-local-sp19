git-novice
==========

An introduction to version control for single users using git. This lesson
doesn't cover collaborative git, but does introduce users to pushing to remote
repositories for personal use. 
Please see <https://illinois-cse.github.io/git-local-fa18/> for a rendered version of this material.

This lesson is an abridged version of and 
heavily influenced by the carpentries' lesson `git-novice`.
