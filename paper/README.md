This folder contains some example files to write a paper using LaTeX with
version control. The Makefile should compile the paper for you, and a pdf will
be generated. 

To clean out the folder, execute `make clean`, and the extraneous latex files
will be deleted. 

If you aren't sure about writing a paper this way and you'd like something
rendered more frequently, you
can instead use Overleaf, which renders the paper for you alongside the raw tex
files. Overleaf
offers github integration. You can read about that here:

The references for this paper were found at the Cat Papers git repository, a
